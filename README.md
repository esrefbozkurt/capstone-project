# TrackFit 
web development capstone-project at neue fische 

## Description

My capstone project is about a fitness app, called TrackFit, in which the user is able to create their own workouts from a selection of exercises, that are queried via an api. In addition, the user is able to save information such as weights, repetitions and sets in the created workout exercises and to compare this with the previous information.

Technologies used:
JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose, Styled Components
